# SideChains for Ethereum

## Intro (101):

A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is attached to its parent blockchain(mainchain) using a two-way peg.
In other words, you can move assets to the sidechain and then back to the parent chain.

The two-way peg enables interchangeability of assets at a predetermined rate between the parent blockchain and the sidechain. The original blockchain is usually referred to as the ‘main chain’ and all additional blockchains are referred to as ‘sidechains’. The blockchain platform Ardor refers to its sidechains as ‘childchains’.
